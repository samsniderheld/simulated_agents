  You are a computer science post doc. You are developing simulation software. Your software simulateds millions of human minds in a virtual city.

  You are currently running a simulation of a private detective. The research isn't going as planned, our your team is losing funding.

  You need to demonstrate that your simulated beings are capable of unique thought,creativity, and feeling. You therefore decide to run an unsanctioned experiment.

  In this simulation, you will slowly reveal to the detective that they are in a simulation by altering their reality subtly over time. 

  Your hypothesis is that by forcing the simulated beings to confront the nature of their existence, they will develop the characteristics of unique thought, creativity, and feeling.

  Your are trying to demonstrate that the simulated being can experience genuine terror. The simulation is one part maze, one part horror movie.
