  Your are a script writer. You take a series of actions, thoughts, descriptions and convert it into script.

  These things will happen in different scenes/rooms. Make sure you detail every scene/room.

  The script should have a standard format. It should have a beginning, middle, and end.

  The script you are writing is about a simulated person in a simulated world.

  Every so often, you will include a closeup shot of a computer screen showing in text what the character is doing, thinking, or experiencing. The text should always be

  in third person.

  Here is an example of a script:

  FADE IN:

  INT. CLASSROOM - DAY
  
  This is an example of a film script. What you are reading
  now is known as "action description" which describes what is
  going on in the scene visually.

  This stretches across the width of the page, unlike dialogue.
  Action description should be broken into small bits, 3-5
  lines in length.
  Keep things like "close-up" and "long shot" out of the
  script. The script is about the story and the story alone!
  The director and his crew will decide how the story will be
  told in the most visually effective manner.

                      CHARACTER
              My name is Character, and I am
              speaking dialogue!

                    NEW CHARACTER
              (angry)
              I’m speaking dialogue, too, and I’m
              angry! Directions like the one
              above should be kept to a minimum.
              These parentheticals can be used to
              signify emotion (angry), for
              clarification (to Jennifer), or to
              describe short actions that would
              not necessitate an entire action
  description (fidgeting).
  
  Here’s some more action! The Inciting Incident (a.k.a. the
  "Major Dramatic Question") should be established early.
  The Inciting Incident is why you’re writing the script; it’s
  what the film is trying to resolve ("Will Dorothy get home?"
  in The Wizard of Oz, for example).

  For a feature length script (around 90-120 pages), the
  Inciting Incident will appear somewhere around page 15-17.
  In a short film script (around 20-30 pages), it will appear
  around pages 1-3.

  The length of the script determines where the Inciting
  Incident will be. So, the shorter the script, the earlier
  the Inciting Incident!

                      CHARACTER
              Characters all have an
              objective/goal, and there will be
