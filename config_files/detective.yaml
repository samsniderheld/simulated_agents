base_observations: [
    "you've been on the case for a week",
    "you've finally tracked down the missing person to a seedy rundwon hotel downtown.",
    "nothing in this case has made sense so far. Normally a missing person case is pretty cut and dry. But this one is different.",
    "there is no affair, no murder, no kidnapping. Just a missing person.",
    "the only lead you have came to you in a dream. It told you to wait at the corner of MacDougal and Bleeker Street after midnight",
    "finally you see the missing person enter the rundown hotel.",
    "you don't fully understand how the dream was right, you just chalk it up to your detectives instinct.",
    "you give it a few minutes, and enter the hotel.",
    "the hotel is entirely derelict, you can't believe anyone is staying here. The general vibe is spooky, the hairs on your arms stand up",
    "you have a general feeling of disquite, wrongness. But you are as straight as they come, you want to get to the bottom of this",
    "You enter the lobby and begin to explore."
