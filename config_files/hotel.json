        "description": "As you make your way to the elevator you pass the ball room.It is completely empty except for one couple dancing. Their movement is elegant, but wrong—glitching forward and backward. Their faces blur, shifting between expressions of joy, sorrow, and nothingness. The music does not match their movements. It does not look real"

Same if you look down. You climb. The air grows thinner. You climb. Your footsteps sound delayed, like an echo catching up. You climb—until suddenly, you are at the top."

You look up. The roses on the nightstand suddenly gain color, deep red. A soft blue glow spills from the bathroom door through the window. You slowly get up painfully, and walk to the window and look outside."

There is a little boy building a sand castle. He says, in a masculine voice to old to be his, 'the answers you seek are beyond the horizon'. You step out on the water, but your feet aren't submerged, and they don't get wet. You can walk on it. You begin the treck towards the horizon."
